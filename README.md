Evaluasi Produk dan Strategi  Pemasaran Perusahaan A  Melalui Segmentasi Pelanggan dan Identifikasi Produk Terlaris

This project aimed to solve three main business problems: identifying best-selling products, evaluating marketing performance, and customer segmentation. To achieve these goals, a meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting date formats to ensure accurate analysis.

The analysis yielded three main conclusions:

One specific product was successfully identified as having the highest sales rate compared to other products.

The regression model indicated that the expedited shipping type and the month of February were the most significant variables affecting delivery delays.

The RFM model analysis successfully classified customers into seven distinct segments, ranging from "best customers" and "loyal customers" to "at-risk customers," enabling more targeted marketing strategies.
